			<p><em>feminism all night</em> is a communal immersive all night long learning experiment to center feminism. it is a call to the community to engage together in feminism: the political, social, economical movement coming to fully challenge and resist patriarchy while dreaming up and manifesting a visionary new way of existence.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>this project is composed of:</p>
			<li>a 3 day intentional training for workshop leaders to develop their session in northern CA</li>
			<li>a public all night long gathering with workshops on feminism open to all  in downtown Oakland, CA </li>
			<br>

						<br>


			<div class="section-heading">immersive training</div>
                
                <p>what happens when we come to study ancient texts from a feminist lens? how do we heal historical patriarchy through cultivating relationship with scripture? what if we showed up for this process with love, commitment, and devotion?
					<br><br>
				these questions are the building blocks of forming a feminist <em>beit midrash</em> (jewish house of learning). a 3-day learning playground in the study of feminism and judaism, this training is an all inclusive learning space for participants to grow their skills in text learning, feminist thinking, and workshop facilitation. 
				<br><br>
				the training will offer participants time to personally grow in their learning and engage in divine devotion. participants will be supported in developing a workshop to be taught at the community wide event. the training will offer space for experimentation in leading the workshop and learning platform to deepen the intentionality and meaning of the session. we encourage diverse topics such as how feminism relates to race, capitalism, the body, sex, romance, money, learning, spirituality, violence, emotional world, politics, the moment that we are in right now, etc. we also encourage various mediums of learning such as movement, singing, text-study, writing, and more.

<div class="title">Consent and care in the Beit Midrash (house of study)*</div>
<div class="leader">Sarah Silverman</div>

<div class="description">In Torah study (and in any radical act), we must have the necessary support to process the physical and emotional impacts of our study. Together we will use the frameworks of consent and care to envision a jewish text study space that 1) Prepares learners to approach difficult content, and supports them in processing it 2) Does not deflect or excuse misogyny and other forms of violence, but confronts it and centers it as an important topic for deconstruction and interpretation and 3) Recognizes the importance of personal story-telling as a form of care. I will also share a new project: A content warning for the Talmud.<br>
*We will work on other translations</div>

<div class="title">How We Get There; Feminism & The Transportation Revolution</div>
<div class="leader">Muriel MacDonald</div>

<div class="description">The bicycle was hailed as the vehicle of women's liberation. Public buses have been the staging grounds of civil rights battles. In some cases, public transportation has served as the great equalizer. In an era of new transportation options, what are the front lines of transportation equity? How can we design our future cities so that public space serves people instead of cars? Workshop participants will look at unique ways that we are reimagining our cityscapes, participate in a conversation centered on both problems and solutions, and finally make some art envisioning what future cities could look like.</div>
<div class="bio">Muriel MacDonald is an artist and activist interested in how we use public space. As the Dir. of Public Affairs for shared electric scooter company, Skip, she has been in conversation with underserved communities across the country about their transportation needs, desire for safe streets, and other frustrations with the cityscape. As an artist, Muriel is interested in how public space can be used to build a resilient society. Her installations include the post-election "Wall of Empathy" which transformed 16th St Bart into a collective art piece full of notes of empathy, anger and discussions about how to move forward, and Haight Free Love, a post-capitalist pop-up space demonstrating community and love to passersby (in which she is one of many collaborators). As an activist, Muriel engages in efforts directed at reclaiming public space from cars and returning it to people, including participating in the San Francisco bred "Human Protected Bike Lanes," and the car-free-streets initiative Sunday Streets.</div>

<div class="title">Feminism and Men </div>
<div class="leader">Ari Eisenstadt, Eyal Matalon, and Eli Wirtschafter</div>

<div class="description">How can men engage in feminist work? How are men harmed by ideas of masculinity? What does it mean for men to have feminist intimate relationships? This workshop is for all genders, and we especially encourage people who identify as men to participate. </div>
<div class="bio">Ari Eisenstadt, Eyal Matalon, and Eli Wirtschafter meet regularly for a feminist men's group that was inspired by last year's feminism all night.</div>

<p class="center">~~ workshop 2 ~~</p>

<div class="title">Queering Judaism or Making Judaism More Queer-Inclusive? A Conversation on Reclamation, Definition, and Allyship.</div>
<div class="leader">Nehama Rogozen</div>

<div class="description">The word "queer" carries a much different meaning than it used to. On one hand, we have Queer Eye and queer Talmud study. On the other, LGBTQ-identifying folks still face health care access issues, social barriers, and discrimination in Jewish communities of all types. How does the word "queer" influence our understanding of Judaism, the world, and justice as we move towards a more queer world? This conversation, open to all, regardless of sexual or gender identity, will look at how we can make our communities more open and inclusive.</div>

<div class="title">How to think clearly & feel fully at the same time</div>
<div class="leader">David Louis</div>

<div class="description">Whether it’s men & women, capital & labor, colonizer & colonized, or settler & indigenous, much revolutionary thought posits that the only route towards liberation lies in conflict between oppressor and oppressed – and potentially the destruction of one by the other. This Manichaean way of thinking has informed some of the most powerful liberatory movements of the past century, but can easily align with reductive or reactionary modes of thought as well. From a different angle, ways of knowing that emphasize subtlety, energy, intuition, and embodiment can be personally and collectively transformative, but easily co-opted to serve violent systems.<br>
How do we hold binary categories of oppression and exploitation in one hand, and nondualistic modes of knowing in the other? How do we maintain the searing drive toward justice NOW with the slowness of processing, learning, and growth? What is the place of healing when the wounds of patriarchy, capitalism, and settler empire are still being inflicted?</div>
<div class="bio">David is a white & Ashkenazi transfemme organizer & facilitator.</div>

<div class="title">Unraveling the (patriarchal) scripts in our (romantic) relationships: exploring liberatory frameworks</div>
<div class="leader">Natalie Rabb and Austin Weisgrau</div>

<div class="description">the patriarchy confounds love by tying us to unconscious scripts about who we are, what we want, and how we should get it. these scripts confuse us and stress us out to the extent that they are not aligned with reality. we'll share our meal metaphor, relationship anarchy, and the tantric consort as three helpful frameworks that can be brought to relationship to see through personal and cultural scripts, come into deeper alignment with our hearts, and invite more clarity and intention into the shared project of connection.</div>
<div class="bio">austin is a dog-whisperer, scorpio sun, saggitarius rising, avoidant vegetarian who is highly sensitive to plant drugs like caffeine. natalie is an intuitive cancer moon renowned for her love of peanut butter who has nowhere to go. the love they share for each other is named james, and james has been subject to field-testing for this material.</div>

<p class="center">~~ workshop 3 ~~</p>

<div class="title">Tracing a Trans Torah</div>
<div class="leader">Binya Koatz</div>

<div class="description">From Adam to Joseph to the Rabbis of the Talmud, Judaism's gender-bending, intergenerational, hella-fey queerness, manifests through our heroes, "patri"archs and wise ones. Alternative feminities, bigendered beings, children with gendersexes "beyond sons and daughters." This stream has always been alive and coursing. Has been known, hidden, and re-discovered many times. In this latest moment of trans liberation that we are in, let's take a dip into this river through the lens of some individual queer and trans people and their lineages in the Torah, and trace the arc of transness at the center of our tradition, from which the dust is beginning to clear.</div>
<div class="bio">Binya is a transfeminine Jewish princess, and b'ezrat hashem, a matriarch-to-be. They hunger for tradition, wrap themselves in heritage like a rainbow-dyed headscarf-prayer-shawl. and try to love and serve Torah and Hashem as best as they can.

<div class="title">The Tree of Life, Tarot and the Hebrew Alphabet:
Pathways to Understanding our Relationality </div>
<div class="leader">Ariella Bea and Rachel Binstock</div>

<div class="description">The 10 Sefirot or the 10 attributes of God (through which the infinite reveals itself and continually creates creation) are connected by 22 pathways. 22 is the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and the number of Major Arcana in Tarot. In this class we will explore the interconnection of these forms of wisdom through a deep analysis of Aleph, the Fool card, and the connection Aleph creates in the tree of life between Keter (the Crown) and Chochmah (Wisdom). We will examine this relation between the Sefirot, Tarot and the Hebrew alphabet as well as its relation to our own lives, through the making of our own tarot card. (Basic materials provided)</div>
<div class="bio">Rachel Binstock is the director of the Urban Adamah Fellowship. She first became an earth-based jewish educator at Eden Village Camp on the East Coast where she served as assistant farm director and lead educator. Before her career as a farmer Rachel worked as a community organizer in her home town of Chicago. She also identifies as an artist, ritualist, and lover-of-plants. She aims to build the world she wants to live in. Rachel spends her spare time practicing primitive skills, singing, playing soccer, and writing saphrut. </div>

<div class="title">Altered state of consciousness and spirituality</div>
<div class="leader">Jackie Mostny</div>
<div class="description">Jackie will explore what it means to put your mind in a different state to solve problems or gain perspective on your life. With intention, changing your state of consciousness can be used as a therapeutic tool. Here she will discuss different ways to achieve this and how changing frequencies in your body and mind can help you channel this new state of consciousness. This will be a discussion. Feel free to share personal stories.</div>

<p class="center">~~ workshop 4 ~~</p>

<div class="title">Sex: a conversation</div>
<div class="leader">Tamara Skootsky</div>
<div class="description">This workshop is an experiment in holding space for inquiry around sex (ie, what is it?) and expression of sexual experience (ie, how/do/can we talk about it and what does it feel like to do so?). We will primarily engage in discussion and partner sharing, with some writing and invitation for any activities that support the learning process.</div>
<div class="bio">As part of a years-long personal journey, Tamara has engaged close friends and family in numerous conversations around topics of sex, sexuality, attraction, desire, pleasure, and power. She believes deeply in the value of holding such conversations and is passionate about expanding the contexts and communities in which they may occur.</div>

<div class="title">What is God Anyway? (and is connecting to it a thing?)</div>
<div class="leader">Simon Mont</div>
<div class="description">The word "God" brings up a lot. Its been leveraged as a liberatory force, a healing invocation, and a patriarchical rationalization.  Its brought people together and torn people apart, and it continues to have deep resonance through many communities. This is a space for us to be real about what that word evokes in us, what it means to us, and how it informs our lives (or doesn't).  Its a space for us to practice deep humility and curiosity as we all connect around something that absolutely none of us understand.
<br>
Bring your history, your stories, your practices, and your openness to connect with the reality of other people's experiences of this mystery we live in.  Simon will bring some conversation starters and practices they learned from their Judaism to contribute too. Let's see what happens when we try to connect with each other with awareness of the holy mystery.  Meditation, song, chats, dances, cuddles. All is welcome.
</div>
<div class="bio">Simon is trying to figure out how to love, heal, connect, and serve.  Sometimes its pretty, some times its not.  They have been wrestling with their own relationship to spirituality, religion, love, their body, and Judaism since they were a kid and just now finding the grounding to be fully open about that journey with others.  Simon writes, performs, facilitates, and hugs trees.</div>

			<div class="leader">Sasha Gayle-Schneider</div>
			<div class="description">How do I benefit from white supremacy and anti-blackness? What does my Jewish culture or faith have to say about Black livelihood?<br>I don’t really want to deal with all this! Where is my stake in this mess? Indeed, it’s is a balagan! Thankfully Alicia Garza and Rabbi Yehuda teach us that healing is possible through our willfull redistribution of resource to account for damages across 5 categories: physical damages, emotional labor/pain, neglect for each others health-care, lack of employment opportunity, and our collective xenophobia. Together, tonight, we will joyfully and tenderly realize that black liberation necessitates the liberation of captured land, stolen capital and our abounding Jewish selves as we draw from this oral Torah in its truest forms: the Platform for Black Lives, and Bava Kama Chapter 8.<br>Everyone is welcome in this workshop!! This text study will focus materially on questions and revelations that impact all of our lives. The workshop will, however, address most centrally the experience of white-Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi people who do not experience anti-blackness in their day-to-day lives.</div>

<div class="leader">Julie Aronowitz</div>
<div class="description">First, second, and third wave feminists have done extensive thinking about the impact of feminism on our society and on us as individuals. Though considering the impact of racism is not new, the framework of white supremacy and it’s impacts have not been as thoroughly explored. Less of a history lesson and more of a group discussion, this conversation will consider the lessons of feminism and the wisdom it might have to offer to addressing white supremacy.</div>

<div class="leader">Nehama Rogozen and Samantha Goldman</div>
<div class="description">In the Jewish tradition, Eishet Chayil a  poem from Proverbs, extolls the virtues of a seemingly perfect woman; It  is customarily sung by a husband to his wife before Shabbat dinner on Friday evening Before we dismiss this text as reinforcing the patriarchy, we will utilize text study and discussion to take a deeper dive to better understand the broader historical context and its relevance today. Join us for the collective reimagining of this tradition in its celebration of the feminine presence and extolling the valiance and force of women everywhere!

<div class="title">i am implicit: a writing workshop</div>
<div class="leader">hannah rubin</div>

<div class="description">"My wild intuition about myself. But the main thing is always hidden. I am implicit. And when I make myself explicit I lose the humid intimacy." <br>
-- Clarice Lispector <br> <br>

"When you say this, you want to lift him up and carry him out to some clean river to soak, watch the rings of filth float from his body. But you also want to piss on him. You imagine his face sprinkled with your vitamin-bright urine. You want to unload." <br> 
-- Ronaldo Wilson <br> <br>

"No, I am not chipping away at anything" <br>
-- Tongo Eisen Martin <br> <br>

"This opens onto a cascade of questions: How to cultivate a poetics that challenges the immunities upon which political sovereignty and its military violence hang? What might it mean for the poem to enable forms of vulnerability and care that are critical for a countervailing communion? How might a poem insist on a visceral solidarity, rather than idealist notions of “human rights” ? Can a poem help us imagine unthinkable solidarities in the interest of transforming the conditions of our conditioned love?" <br>
- Rob Halpern <br> <br>

The moment of looking and being described. How do we embody language, when it exists, so frequently, in a swimming pool of grief for that which it can not do? And also, that which it has already done? What is writing, and voice, and intimacy, in the context of language's violent & colonial history and how can we -- as marginalized bodies -- find voice within it? Can we ever love language the way it has never (really) loved us? In this workshop, we will read experiments, passions, pushings, and pullings. We will engage with language as a material. We will attempt to sculpt and be sculpted. We will grapple with: the implicit, the explicit, the humid intimacy. How we can attempt to have any or all of those things, through language. </div>

<div class="title">Wrong Bodies: an exploration of how oppression lives in the Body</div>
<div class="leader">Faryn Borella</div>

<div class="description">We live in a world where we are taught that there are right bodies, and there are wrong bodies. Right bodies are white, cisgender, male, able, thin, young and heterosexual. Wrong bodies are disabled, trans, gender non-conforming, queer, fat, female, aging, black, and brown. How is the world constructed in a way that caters to those living in “right bodies” while compounded the oppression of those living in bodies considered wrong? How does having a wrong body effect how one moves through the world, and how do the ways in which our bodies are wrong intersect? And is there even such a thing as a “right body?” This workshop, through movement, music, performance and Theater of the Oppressed exercises, will explore the ways that we currently move in our wrong bodies and discover the liberation that comes through moving with and into the “wrong,” rather than against it.</div>

<div class="bio">Faryn is a white, queer, femme with a chronic invisible disability. She currently studies counter-oppressive religious ritual leadership and liberation theology at the Graduate Theological Union in the attempts to build a diasporic, non-Zionist Jewish liberation theology and praxis.

<div class="description">
We'll start out by getting to know each other with Jewish melody and feminist icebreakers. Then we'll work together to articulate what stake men have in feminist struggle, from a perspective of fostering joy and healthy love, in men's relationships with one another and with women and gender queer or non-binary people in our lives (some men are gender queer). We will share experiences and ideas with one another about how to be more vulnerable, less controlling, less entitled, more accountable to the women, non-binary, or gender queer people among us and more effectively contributing to collective liberation from all systems of abusive power, starting with patriarchy. <br><br>

This workshop will focus on the experiences and feminist roles for men, who aren't targeted by sexism, but it is warmly open to people of all genders and will be facilitated with a spirit of honoring the experiences and ideas of whoever is in the room.</div>

<div class="title">Math & Patriarchy</div>
<div class="leader">David Granberg & Becca Heisler</div>
<div class="description">Is math an inherently violent way of knowing? Can quantitative knowledge advance the struggle for liberation and justice, or will it ultimately only serve oppressive structures? Is math actually a route to accessing the Divine? How do we relate to math in our bodies? What, even *is* math? Does a cultural suspicion of scheming malicious mathematical manipulators have anything – anything! – to do with antisemitism?<br><br>

We don’t know the answers to any of these questions but we want to ask them with you. We’ll read, talk, feel, craft – maybe even dance. All levels of (dis)comfort with math enthusiastically welcome. Discussion might include any of the following:<br><br>

numbers – symbolic logic – violence (epistemological) – violence (concrete) – bureaucracy – legibility – abstraction – intuition – the Jubilee year – usury – the blood libel – math anxiety – embodied knowledge – gematria – sephirot – cultural gaslighting – the map is not the territory – “rationality” – the Enlightenment – witchcraft – the Golden ratio – trauma – women in tech – capitalism – Microsoft® Excel® 2016
</div>
<div class="bio">Becca is a long-time lover of math, feminism, the earth, and Judaism, and thinks that it’s totally wild that she can celebrate all of those things in the same place. Becca graduated from Tufts with a degree in Mathematics and spends a lot of time trying to figure out what that actually means – why did people keep congratulating me for being a woman in STEM? Why did math suddenly feel so much more engaging when there were no numbers involved? How do I “use my math” now that I work as a Jewish outdoor educator? WHY does everyone hate math so much? And, most relevant in this moment, what’s math got to do with patriarchy?? 
</div>
<div class="bio">David Granberg has been in a process of refusing and deconstructing masculinity for several years. He (?) is in a state of flux - between the material and the ideal, the masculine and the feminine, the head and the heart, giving and receiving. He took a year of math and physics in college before switching to environmental studies focusing on sustainable agriculture, but it would be a bald-faced lie to say he's never looked back. An organizer and agitator, David has been a part of several campaigns for farmworker justice and fossil fuel divestment, and is currently engaged in several different projects of Jewish community-building and transformation.

<div class="title">Bearing Witness to Sarah & Hagar: Understanding Conflicting Narratives of Sisterhood
</div>
<div class="leader">Anna Goodman-Herrick</div>

<div class="description">Weaving Poetry, Torah, Quran, Traditional Stories, and Modern Experience. <br><br>
 
The story of Sarah and Hagar (Hebrew)/ Hajar (Arabic) is in the Torah and Quran with varying versions and interpretations.  <br><br>
 
In one story, Hagar is Sarah’s slave. Sarah has her husband impregnate Hagar and then exiles her and her child out of jealousy. In another story, Hag/jar is an Egyptian princess first before being captured into slavery for Sarah's household. Hajar’s liberation journey inspires the pilgrimage of Hajj that continues today.  <br><br>
 
Sarah is often considered the matriarch of the Jewish people and Hajar the matriarch of the Adnanin people, the Arab tribe from which Muhammad descended. Among varying traditions, Sarah is a prophet, malicious, jealous, a great mother and wife, an inspiration, an oppressor. Hajar is a princess, a slave, a handmaid, a concubine, a problem, a gift. Together, they are competitors, oppressor/ oppressed, existing as vehicles for birth, and part of a... sisterhood?  <br><br>
 
We will examine how these narratives reflect our own views today - whose lives, bodies, comfort, violence and feminism are prioritized. We consider their meaning on a spiritual level. We look at modes to change the roles of these stories in our lives.  <br><br>
 
Sarah and Hajar’s relationship is a lens into gender, race, power, privilege and our souls.</div>

<div class="title">Feminine Embodiment for all Genders</div>
<div class="leader">Tamara Skootsky</div>
<div class="description">A movement and conversation-based exploration of one’s own needs and wants, and those of others. Participants will be guided through deep listening and intuition exercises, with awareness placed on noticing action-based impulses and anxieties that may or may not be in line with the body’s quieter truth. Depending on time, this will either be an open-ended experience, or can relate back to work and power in society.</div>
<div class="bio">Tamara has spent the past 2.5 years investigating self-knowledge and gender dynamics through intuitive movement & partner dance, dating & relationships, and the workplace.</div></div>

<div class="title">Talmud for Transfemmes: An Intro to Rav Yohanan’s Non-Binary Beauty</div>
<div class="leader">Binya Koatz</div>
<div class="description">Tradition is a scary place for trans people to venture. A space filled with reactionary beliefs used to justify oppressive politics that cut lives short and splinter families and communities today.<br><br>
Tradition, if it gets wielded by the right hands, can also be a place of solace. It can be where trans people go to find beauty, ancestors, role models, parents/mothers/and fathers: things I (we) sorely crave, as we get painted as new-outgrowths of modern immorality, rather than liberated links in a millenia-old chain.<br><br>
Let’s find that “also” in the Talmud. A text brimming with vile hatred, mysoginy and violence, and also a promising source for Jewish trans people to claim the teachings, blessing, and heritage of our people.<br><br>
Rabbi Yohanan, a transfemme in the Talmud, is a foremother I’ve newly discovered, and am excited to *continue learning about* (not teach) alongside some dope ppl in our little radfeminist allnight cabal. See how this very central rabbinic authority is painted with an unabashedly feminine beauty, and confidently straddles roles and presentations in an overwhelmingly binarized system of gender in Jewish law. Learn from an ancestor who is not just incidentally transfemme, but who uses their gender-magic to inform the spirituality that has immortalized them through centuries.<br><br>
The Talmud hasn’t been offered as a pro-trans text. But there’s no one who can stop us from claiming the gifts it gives and the stories it tells. I’m excited to unearth the profound, radical power that exists in the concept of a Trans Tradition, and invite you to learn with me if you are too.</div>
<div class="bio">Binya (bee-nyah, accent on the bee) thinks God rhymes with queerness rhymes with Judaism rhymes with justice. you just have to learn how to pronounce them right ‘they’ pronouns, from new york, and before that a handful of diasporas and fucked up shit and radical-antifas and resilience. heritage is a beautiful gift and a pair of overwhelming shoes to fill. via Alcazarquivir, Rosario, Grenoble and Odessa. yiddish, french, spanish and Djudezmo (ladino) on the tongue. trans and jewish, with the ‘and’ a non-negotiable </div></div>
