<p><i>feminism all night</i> is an urban retreat calling the community to engage together in feminism: the political, social, economical movement coming to fully challenge and resist patriarchy while dreaming up and manifesting a visionary new way of existence.</p>
<br>
<p>the retreat is modeled after shavuot, the jewish holiday calling us to stay up all night to learn together. <i>feminism all night</i> begins with a communal immersive all night long learning experiment to center feminism. it continues with a lunch by the lake and closes with a ritual ceremony to integrate the learnings. our intention is to fully retreat from the city life while still remaining in the city, imitating the art of feminism as it calls us to deconstruct our whole systems of existence while living in them. it is paradoxical and confusing. join us fully for all of it.</p>
<br>
<p><i>what is learning? why night time?</i></p>
<br>
<p>the magic of learning all night long in community cannot be expressed, only experienced. </p>

<div class="title">Reparations from HaChovel (the perpetrator) reading the Platform for Black Lives as Mishna</div>
<div class="leader">Sasha Gayle-Schneider</div>
<div class="description">How do I benefit from white supremacy and anti-blackness? What does my Jewish culture or faith have to say about Black livelihood?<br>
I don’t really want to deal with all this! Where is my stake in this mess? Indeed, it’s is a balagan! Thankfully Alicia Garza and Rabbi Yehuda teach us that healing is possible through our willfull redistribution of resource to account for damages across 5 categories: physical damages, emotional labor/pain, neglect for each others health-care, lack of employment opportunity, and our collective xenophobia. Together, tonight, we will joyfully and tenderly realize that black liberation necessitates the liberation of captured land, stolen capital and our abounding Jewish selves as we draw from this oral Torah in its truest forms: the Platform for Black Lives, and Bava Kama Chapter 8.<br>
Everyone is welcome in this workshop!! This text study will focus materially on questions and revelations that impact all of our lives. The workshop will, however, address most centrally the experience of white-Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi people who do not experience anti-blackness in their day-to-day lives.</div>
<div class="bio">Sasha (they/them) is a Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi educator and organizer. Sasha grew up in the Abraham Joshua Heschel school, absorbed by an intersectional Judaism that has inspired them to continue their studies, receiving their BA in Judaic Studies and Community Organizing at Smith College. Sasha is an alumni of Yeshivat Hadar and former head of Eden Village’s Teen Apprenticeship Program.</div>


<div class="title">past another binary||collective zine creation</div>
<div class="leader">alysha schwartz + ilana newman</div>
<div class="description">masc+femme || male+female || non-men+men || afab+amab<br><br>
join us in a collective exploration of the violent consequences that result from the policing, exclusion, and regulation used to maintain and define gender binaries, in all their forms. encouraging learning and realization through words and art, we will each be making personal, one-page zines, which will work to deconstruct the deep and lasting effects of the enforcement of the gender binary in both society and feminist spaces. <br><br>
***this workshop will include writing and/or drawing</div>
<div class="bio">ilysha/alyshna/ilanysh are into queer healthcare, grandparent histories, cross-denominational summer camp ballads, scrappy crafts, extravagant potlucks, anticapitalist community care, and spreadsheets for the revolution. they seek to create a space to discuss how the gender binary impacts feminism in jewish spaces and beyond.</div>

<div class="title">The Sacred No </div>
<div class="leader">Jennie Kogan</div>
<div class="description">So often in life, we do things we don’t want to do.  We say yes to people when our inner voices are begging us to say no or just when we aren’t sure and need more time.  Through embodiment exercise, partner sharing and writing reflection, this workshop is set to explore why we don’t say no when we want to and what it would feel like to follow our inner truth.  The dominant forces of patriarchy, capitalism, and other systems of power fog our body wisdom and we get confused on what we want.  When we create shields of protection from dominant forces, we are a little less affected by them.  Boundaries can be challenging and when listen to them, we are much more likely to thrive in our mind, body and relationships.  </div>
<div class="bio">Jennie Kogan is honored to have this opportunity to facilitate such an important workshop for her and many others.  From an early age, she has been dedicated to creating spaces of community where people connect with themselves and each other by sharing what we so often hide.  This includes facilitating a college group dedicated to ending the stigma of mental health for 3 years, developing a community play in Scotland and bringing this element of sharing to everything she does.  She has participated in many anti-oppression and personal growth trainings involving the body, mind and spirit and looks forward to bringing elements of what she has learned to this workshop.  The past 3 years in particular have involved working on creating energetic boundaries and learning how to listen to her body which is an ongoing process.  </div>

<div class="title">What does feminism have to teach about white supremacy?</div>
<div class="leader">Julie Aronowitz</div>
<div class="description">First, second, and third wave feminists have done extensive thinking about the impact of feminism on our society and on us as individuals. Though considering the impact of racism is not new, the framework of white supremacy and it’s impacts have not been as thoroughly explored. Less of a history lesson and more of a group discussion, this conversation will consider the lessons of feminism and the wisdom it might have to offer to addressing white supremacy.</div>

<div class="title">Exploring the Woman of Valor/Eishet Chayil in 2017: Unrealistic expectations of a Wonder Woman or a celebration of women’s power?</div>
<div class="leader">Nehama Rogozen and Samantha Goldman</div>
<div class="description">In the Jewish tradition, Eishet Chayil a  poem from Proverbs, extolls the virtues of a seemingly perfect woman; It  is customarily sung by a husband to his wife before Shabbat dinner on Friday evening Before we dismiss this text as reinforcing the patriarchy, we will utilize text study and discussion to take a deeper dive to better understand the broader historical context and its relevance today. Join us for the collective reimagining of this tradition in its celebration of the feminine presence and extolling the valiance and force of women everywhere! No experience with Judaism or Jewish texts necessary for this session.</div>
<div class="bio">Nehama Rogozen and Samantha Goldman are two feminists deeply involved in social justice and Jewish life in the Bay. Nehama works for the City and County of San Francisco’s Office of Financial Empowerment, is a Jeremiah Fellowship alumnae and Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, helped start Minyan Dafna, and holds a Master’s in Development Practice from UC Berkeley.

<div class="title">Wrong Bodies: an exploration of how oppression lives in the Body</div>
<div class="leader">Faryn Borella</div>

<div class="description">We live in a world where we are taught that there are right bodies, and there are wrong bodies. Right bodies are white, cisgender, male, able, thin, young and heterosexual. Wrong bodies are disabled, trans, gender non-conforming, queer, fat, female, aging, black, and brown. How is the world constructed in a way that caters to those living in “right bodies” while compounded the oppression of those living in bodies considered wrong? How does having a wrong body effect how one moves through the world, and how do the ways in which our bodies are wrong intersect? And is there even such a thing as a “right body?” This workshop, through movement, music, performance and Theater of the Oppressed exercises, will explore the ways that we currently move in our wrong bodies and discover the liberation that comes through moving with and into the “wrong,” rather than against it.</div>

<div class="bio">Faryn is a white, queer, femme with a chronic invisible disability. She currently studies counter-oppressive religious ritual leadership and liberation theology at the Graduate Theological Union in the attempts to build a diasporic, non-Zionist Jewish liberation theology and praxis. She is a longtime activist  for Palestinian liberation and disability justice. She also spends her time writing disability-themed poetry and performance art, singing obscure songs from musicals to herself and learning with/from children about justice and Judaism.</div>

<p style="text-align: center">workshop 3: 1:00 - 2:30</p>

<div class="title">Math & Patriarchy</div>
<div class="leader">David Granberg & Becca Heisler</div>
<div class="description">Is math an inherently patriarchal way of knowing? Can quantitative knowledge advance the struggle for liberation and justice, or will it ultimately only serve oppressive structures? Is math actually a route to accessing the Divine? How do we relate to math in our bodies? What, even *is* math? Does a cultural suspicion of scheming malicious mathematical manipulators have anything – anything! – to do with antisemitism?<br><br>

We don’t know the answers to any of these questions but we want to ask them with you. We’ll read, talk, feel – maybe even dance. Discussion might include any of the following:<br><br>

numbers – symbolic logic – violence (epistemological) – violence (concrete) – bureaucracy – legibility – abstraction – intuition – the Jubilee year – usury – the blood libel – math anxiety – embodied knowledge – gematria – sephirot – cultural gaslighting – the map is not the territory – “rationality” – the Enlightenment – witchcraft – the Golden ratio – trauma – women in tech – capitalism – Microsoft® Excel® 2016

<div class="description">Did you ever wonder if Miriam had a favorite song? Sara’s favorite tea to serve guests? Rachel a favorite sexual position? Come, let’s flesh out our matriarchs, writing their forgotten stories by candle flame. We will then stand, and give voice to them, as we read their stories, which are also our stories.</div>

<div class="bio">Aviva Frank knows the Schkeniah lives in each of us; we can coax her out with weaving tales, sining songs and honoring her-story. Writer, Kohenet and spoken word artist, Aviva has lived in Tel Aviv, New York and San Francisco.</div>


<div class="title">Nasty Women in Numbers: The Daughters of Tzlofechad</div>
<div class="leader">Raphael Magarik</div>
<div class="description">By looking at a story from Numbers of women protesting sexist laws, we’ll ask questions about feminist critique, patriarchal cooption, and the difficulties of recovering a usable feminist past from the Bible.</div>

<div class="title">Feminine Embodiment for all Genders</div>
<div class="leader">Tamara Skootsky</div>
<div class="description">A movement and conversation-based exploration of one’s own needs and wants, and those of others. Participants will be guided through deep listening and intuition exercises, with awareness placed on noticing action-based impulses and anxieties that may or may not be in line with the body’s quieter truth. Depending on time, this will either be an open-ended experience, or can relate back to work and power in society.</div>
<div class="bio">Tamara has spent the past 2.5 years investigating self-knowledge and gender dynamics through intuitive movement & partner dance, dating & relationships, and the workplace.</div>

<div class="title">Talmud for Transfemmes: An Intro to Rav Yohanan’s Non-Binary Beauty</div>
<div class="leader">Binya Koatz</div>
<div class="description">Tradition is a scary place for trans people to venture. A space filled with reactionary beliefs used to justify oppressive politics that cut lives short and splinter families and communities today.<br><br>
Tradition, if it gets wielded by the right hands, can also be a place of solace. It can be where trans people go to find beauty, ancestors, role models, parents/mothers/and fathers: things I (we) sorely crave, as we get painted as new-outgrowths of modern immorality, rather than liberated links in a millenia-old chain.<br><br>
Let’s find that “also” in the Talmud. A text brimming with vile hatred, mysoginy and violence, and also a promising source for Jewish trans people to claim the teachings, blessing, and heritage of our people.<br><br>
Rabbi Yohanan, a transfemme in the Talmud, is a foremother I’ve newly discovered, and am excited to *continue learning about* (not teach) alongside some dope ppl in our little radfeminist allnight cabal. See how this very central rabbinic authority is painted with an unabashedly feminine beauty, and confidently straddles roles and presentations in an overwhelmingly binarized system of gender in Jewish law. Learn from an ancestor who is not just incidentally transfemme, but who uses their gender-magic to inform the spirituality that has immortalized them through centuries.<br><br>
The Talmud hasn’t been offered as a pro-trans text. But there’s no one who can stop us from claiming the gifts it gives and the stories it tells. I’m excited to unearth the profound, radical power that exists in the concept of a Trans Tradition, and invite you to learn with me if you are too.</div>
<div class="bio">Binya (bee-nyah, accent on the bee) thinks God rhymes with queerness rhymes with Judaism rhymes with justice. you just have to learn how to pronounce them right < ‘they’ pronouns, from new york, and before that a handful of diasporas and fucked up shit and radical-antifas and resilience. heritage is a beautiful gift and a pair of overwhelming shoes to fill. via Alcazarquivir, Rosario, Grenoble and Odessa. yiddish, french, spanish and Djudezmo (ladino) on the tongue. trans and jewish, with the ‘and’ a non-negotiable </div>

<div class="title">Activism & the Schkeniah</div>
<div class="leader">Aviva Melissa Frank and Ariel Vergosen</div>
<div class="description">Aviva Frank and Ariel Vergosen are both Kohenet: Hebrew Priestess sisters and international activists. They each bring their own unique talents and traits to this workshop and a mutual love of glitter. Learn, laugh and leave with a greater understanding of your own power and the Schkeniah that resides in all of us regardless of gender.</div>
<div class="bio">Aviva Frank and Ariel Vergosen both engage in resistance work rooted in the theatrical and driven by the principles of engagement, inclusivity and community building.</div>
