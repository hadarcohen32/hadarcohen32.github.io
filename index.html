			<div class="section-heading">about</div>
			<p><em>feminism all night</em> is a communal immersive all night long learning experiment to center feminism. it is a call to the community to engage together in feminism: the political, social, economical movement coming to fully challenge and resist patriarchy while dreaming up and manifesting a visionary new way of existence.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>this project is composed of:</p>
			<li>a 3 day intentional training for workshop leaders to develop their session in northern CA</li>
			<li>a public all night long gathering with workshops on feminism open to all  in downtown Oakland, CA </li>
			<br>
						<br>
			<br>
						<br>


			<div class="section-heading">immersive training</div>
                
                <p>what happens when we come to study ancient texts from a feminist lens? how do we heal historical patriarchy through cultivating relationship with scripture? what if we showed up for this process with love, commitment, and devotion?
					<br><br>
				these questions are the building blocks of forming a feminist <em>beit midrash</em> (jewish house of learning). a 3-day learning playground in the study of feminism and judaism, this training is an all inclusive learning space for participants to grow their skills in text learning, feminist thinking, and workshop facilitation. 
				<br><br>
				the training will offer participants time to personally grow in their learning and engage in divine devotion. participants will be supported in developing a workshop to be taught at the community wide event. the training will offer space for experimentation in leading the workshop and learning platform to deepen the intentionality and meaning of the session. we encourage diverse topics such as how feminism relates to race, capitalism, the body, sex, romance, money, learning, spirituality, violence, emotional world, politics, the moment that we are in right now, etc. we also encourage various mediums of learning such as movement, singing, text-study, writing, and more.

			<div class="leader">Sasha Gayle-Schneider</div>
			<div class="description">How do I benefit from white supremacy and anti-blackness? What does my Jewish culture or faith have to say about Black livelihood?<br>I don’t really want to deal with all this! Where is my stake in this mess? Indeed, it’s is a balagan! Thankfully Alicia Garza and Rabbi Yehuda teach us that healing is possible through our willfull redistribution of resource to account for damages across 5 categories: physical damages, emotional labor/pain, neglect for each others health-care, lack of employment opportunity, and our collective xenophobia. Together, tonight, we will joyfully and tenderly realize that black liberation necessitates the liberation of captured land, stolen capital and our abounding Jewish selves as we draw from this oral Torah in its truest forms: the Platform for Black Lives, and Bava Kama Chapter 8.<br>Everyone is welcome in this workshop!! This text study will focus materially on questions and revelations that impact all of our lives. The workshop will, however, address most centrally the experience of white-Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi people who do not experience anti-blackness in their day-to-day lives.</div>
			<div class="bio">Sasha (they/them) is a Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi educator and organizer.

<div class="title">What does feminism have to teach about white supremacy?</div>
<div class="leader">Julie Aronowitz</div>
<div class="description">First, second, and third wave feminists have done extensive thinking about the impact of feminism on our society and on us as individuals. Though considering the impact of racism is not new, the framework of white supremacy and it’s impacts have not been as thoroughly explored. Less of a history lesson and more of a group discussion, this conversation will consider the lessons of feminism and the wisdom it might have to offer to addressing white supremacy.</div>

<div class="description">What is emotional labor? How does it show up in my life? Do I want to do it? Do I want other people to do it? Together we will graciously dissect and deconstruct all that is emotional labor. We will support each other in identifying the ways emotional labor shows up in our life, affirm and acknowledge the ways we enjoy providing this labor, as well as empower one another to step away from the emotional labor we no longer wish to serve.</div>

<div class="title">Exploring the Woman of Valor/Eishet Chayil in 2017: Unrealistic expectations of a Wonder Woman or a celebration of women’s power?</div>
<div class="leader">Nehama Rogozen and Samantha Goldman</div>
<div class="description">In the Jewish tradition, Eishet Chayil a  poem from Proverbs, extolls the virtues of a seemingly perfect woman; It  is customarily sung by a husband to his wife before Shabbat dinner on Friday evening Before we dismiss this text as reinforcing the patriarchy, we will utilize text study and discussion to take a deeper dive to better understand the broader historical context and its relevance today. Join us for the collective reimagining of this tradition in its celebration of the feminine presence and extolling the valiance and force of women everywhere! No experience with Judaism or Jewish texts necessary for this session.</div>

<div class="title">i am implicit: a writing workshop</div>
<div class="leader">hannah rubin</div>

<div class="description">"My wild intuition about myself. But the main thing is always hidden. I am implicit. And when I make myself explicit I lose the humid intimacy." <br>
-- Clarice Lispector <br> <br>

"When you say this, you want to lift him up and carry him out to some clean river to soak, watch the rings of filth float from his body. But you also want to piss on him. You imagine his face sprinkled with your vitamin-bright urine. You want to unload." <br> 
-- Ronaldo Wilson <br> <br>

"No, I am not chipping away at anything" <br>
-- Tongo Eisen Martin <br> <br>

"This opens onto a cascade of questions: How to cultivate a poetics that challenges the immunities upon which political sovereignty and its military violence hang? What might it mean for the poem to enable forms of vulnerability and care that are critical for a countervailing communion? How might a poem insist on a visceral solidarity, rather than idealist notions of “human rights” ? Can a poem help us imagine unthinkable solidarities in the interest of transforming the conditions of our conditioned love?" <br>
- Rob Halpern <br> <br>

The moment of looking and being described. How do we embody language, when it exists, so frequently, in a swimming pool of grief for that which it can not do? And also, that which it has already done? What is writing, and voice, and intimacy, in the context of language's violent & colonial history and how can we -- as marginalized bodies -- find voice within it? Can we ever love language the way it has never (really) loved us? In this workshop, we will read experiments, passions, pushings, and pullings. We will engage with language as a material. We will attempt to sculpt and be sculpted. We will grapple with: the implicit, the explicit, the humid intimacy. How we can attempt to have any or all of those things, through language. </div>

<div class="title">Wrong Bodies: an exploration of how oppression lives in the Body</div>
<div class="leader">Faryn Borella</div>

<div class="description">We live in a world where we are taught that there are right bodies, and there are wrong bodies. Right bodies are white, cisgender, male, able, thin, young and heterosexual. Wrong bodies are disabled, trans, gender non-conforming, queer, fat, female, aging, black, and brown. How is the world constructed in a way that caters to those living in “right bodies” while compounded the oppression of those living in bodies considered wrong? How does having a wrong body effect how one moves through the world, and how do the ways in which our bodies are wrong intersect? And is there even such a thing as a “right body?” This workshop, through movement, music, performance and Theater of the Oppressed exercises, will explore the ways that we currently move in our wrong bodies and discover the liberation that comes through moving with and into the “wrong,” rather than against it.</div>

<div class="bio">Faryn is a white, queer, femme with a chronic invisible disability. She currently studies counter-oppressive religious ritual leadership and liberation theology at the Graduate Theological Union in the attempts to build a diasporic, non-Zionist Jewish liberation theology and praxis. She is a longtime activist  for Palestinian liberation and disability justice. She also spends her time writing disability-themed poetry and performance art, singing obscure songs from musicals to herself and learning with/from children about justice and Judaism.</div></div>

 <div class="title">Tikkun Olam through informed allyship: supporting survivors of sexual assault
</div>
<div class="leader">Miriam Joelson</div>

<div class="description">What are the psychological ramifications of sexual assault? How can we better support survivors of sexual assault in our communities? In this workshop, we will talk about healing the world through small acts of kindness - mitzvot - in the shape of informed allyship. While the workshop is anchored in understanding the psychological effects of sexual assault, and how we can be better allies to survivors, we will open the conversation to mental health awareness and mental health allyship in general.</div>

<div class="bio">Miriam is the Founder of <a href="http://www.projecthereforyou.org/">Project #HereForYou</a>, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness for the psychological ramifications of sexual assault. This fall, Miriam will be attending the Brown School of Social work at Washington University in St. Louis, where she will study clinical mental health. Originally from Switzerland, Miriam currently works at Google in the Bay Area, received her A.B., magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, from Brown University, and her M.Sc. from the University of Oxford. </div></div>

<div class="title">"Men's Work": Men Showing up for Feminism with Joy, Vulnerability & Accountability
</div>
<div class="leader">Jonah Sampson Boyarin</div>
<div class="description">
We'll start out by getting to know each other with Jewish melody and feminist icebreakers. Then we'll work together to articulate what stake men have in feminist struggle, from a perspective of fostering joy and healthy love, in men's relationships with one another and with women and gender queer or non-binary people in our lives (some men are gender queer). We will share experiences and ideas with one another about how to be more vulnerable, less controlling, less entitled, more accountable to the women, non-binary, or gender queer people among us and more effectively contributing to collective liberation from all systems of abusive power, starting with patriarchy. <br><br>

This workshop will focus on the experiences and feminist roles for men, who aren't targeted by sexism, but it is warmly open to people of all genders and will be facilitated with a spirit of honoring the experiences and ideas of whoever is in the room.</div>
<div class="bio">Jonah Sampson Boyarin loves teaching and learning! He has served as an educator-leader in a number of capacities; in 2016, he cofounded the country’s first Diversity & Equity program at a Jewish day school, at JCHS of the Bay. Jonah recently embarked on a year of study and adventure, completing his yoga teacher training in Singapore, two terms at Machon Hadar’s yeshivah program, and an Emerging Translator Fellowship at the National Yiddish Book Center.</div></div>

<div class="title">Math & Patriarchy</div>
<div class="leader">David Granberg & Becca Heisler</div>
<div class="description">Is math an inherently violent way of knowing? Can quantitative knowledge advance the struggle for liberation and justice, or will it ultimately only serve oppressive structures? Is math actually a route to accessing the Divine? How do we relate to math in our bodies? What, even *is* math? Does a cultural suspicion of scheming malicious mathematical manipulators have anything – anything! – to do with antisemitism?<br><br>

We don’t know the answers to any of these questions but we want to ask them with you. We’ll read, talk, feel, craft – maybe even dance. All levels of (dis)comfort with math enthusiastically welcome. Discussion might include any of the following:<br><br>

numbers – symbolic logic – violence (epistemological) – violence (concrete) – bureaucracy – legibility – abstraction – intuition – the Jubilee year – usury – the blood libel – math anxiety – embodied knowledge – gematria – sephirot – cultural gaslighting – the map is not the territory – “rationality” – the Enlightenment – witchcraft – the Golden ratio – trauma – women in tech – capitalism – Microsoft® Excel® 2016
</div>
<div class="bio">Becca is a long-time lover of math, feminism, the earth, and Judaism, and thinks that it’s totally wild that she can celebrate all of those things in the same place. Becca graduated from Tufts with a degree in Mathematics and spends a lot of time trying to figure out what that actually means – why did people keep congratulating me for being a woman in STEM? Why did math suddenly feel so much more engaging when there were no numbers involved? How do I “use my math” now that I work as a Jewish outdoor educator? WHY does everyone hate math so much? And, most relevant in this moment, what’s math got to do with patriarchy?? 
</div>
<div class="bio">David Granberg has been in a process of refusing and deconstructing masculinity for several years. He (?) is in a state of flux - between the material and the ideal, the masculine and the feminine, the head and the heart, giving and receiving. He took a year of math and physics in college before switching to environmental studies focusing on sustainable agriculture, but it would be a bald-faced lie to say he's never looked back. An organizer and agitator, David has been a part of several campaigns for farmworker justice and fossil fuel divestment, and is currently engaged in several different projects of Jewish community-building and transformation.

<div class="title">Bearing Witness to Sarah & Hagar: Understanding Conflicting Narratives of Sisterhood
</div>
<div class="leader">Anna Goodman-Herrick</div>

<div class="description">Weaving Poetry, Torah, Quran, Traditional Stories, and Modern Experience. <br><br>
 
The story of Sarah and Hagar (Hebrew)/ Hajar (Arabic) is in the Torah and Quran with varying versions and interpretations.  <br><br>
 
In one story, Hagar is Sarah’s slave. Sarah has her husband impregnate Hagar and then exiles her and her child out of jealousy. In another story, Hag/jar is an Egyptian princess first before being captured into slavery for Sarah's household. Hajar’s liberation journey inspires the pilgrimage of Hajj that continues today.  <br><br>
 
Sarah is often considered the matriarch of the Jewish people and Hajar the matriarch of the Adnanin people, the Arab tribe from which Muhammad descended. Among varying traditions, Sarah is a prophet, malicious, jealous, a great mother and wife, an inspiration, an oppressor. Hajar is a princess, a slave, a handmaid, a concubine, a problem, a gift. Together, they are competitors, oppressor/ oppressed, existing as vehicles for birth, and part of a... sisterhood?  <br><br>
 
We will examine how these narratives reflect our own views today - whose lives, bodies, comfort, violence and feminism are prioritized. We consider their meaning on a spiritual level. We look at modes to change the roles of these stories in our lives.  <br><br>
 
Sarah and Hajar’s relationship is a lens into gender, race, power, privilege and our souls.</div>

<div class="bio">Anna Goodman-Herrick is a facilitator of sacred spaces and group dialogue, a writer, storyteller, documentarian, creative artist, and human rights activist, whose work has appeared on major television networks, on film, stage, in print, museum and gallery exhibitions and in retreats and workshops.

<div class="description">A movement and conversation-based exploration of one’s own needs and wants, and those of others. Participants will be guided through deep listening and intuition exercises, with awareness placed on noticing action-based impulses and anxieties that may or may not be in line with the body’s quieter truth.

<div class="title">Talmud for Transfemmes: An Intro to Rav Yohanan’s Non-Binary Beauty</div>
<div class="leader">Binya Koatz</div>
<div class="description">Tradition is a scary place for trans people to venture. A space filled with reactionary beliefs used to justify oppressive politics that cut lives short and splinter families and communities today.<br><br>
Tradition, if it gets wielded by the right hands, can also be a place of solace. It can be where trans people go to find beauty, ancestors, role models, parents/mothers/and fathers: things I (we) sorely crave, as we get painted as new-outgrowths of modern immorality, rather than liberated links in a millenia-old chain.<br><br>
Let’s find that “also” in the Talmud. A text brimming with vile hatred, mysoginy and violence, and also a promising source for Jewish trans people to claim the teachings, blessing, and heritage of our people.<br><br>
Rabbi Yohanan, a transfemme in the Talmud, is a foremother I’ve newly discovered, and am excited to *continue learning about* (not teach) alongside some dope ppl in our little radfeminist allnight cabal. See how this very central rabbinic authority is painted with an unabashedly feminine beauty, and confidently straddles roles and presentations in an overwhelmingly binarized system of gender in Jewish law. Learn from an ancestor who is not just incidentally transfemme, but who uses their gender-magic to inform the spirituality that has immortalized them through centuries.<br><br>
The Talmud hasn’t been offered as a pro-trans text. But there’s no one who can stop us from claiming the gifts it gives and the stories it tells. I’m excited to unearth the profound, radical power that exists in the concept of a Trans Tradition, and invite you to learn with me if you are too.</div>
<div class="bio">Binya (bee-nyah, accent on the bee) thinks God rhymes with queerness rhymes with Judaism rhymes with justice. you just have to learn how to pronounce them right ‘they’ pronouns, from new york, and before that a handful of diasporas and fucked up shit and radical-antifas and resilience. heritage is a beautiful gift and a pair of overwhelming shoes to fill. via Alcazarquivir, Rosario, Grenoble and Odessa. yiddish, french, spanish and Djudezmo (ladino) on the tongue. trans and jewish, with the ‘and’ a non-negotiable </div></div>
